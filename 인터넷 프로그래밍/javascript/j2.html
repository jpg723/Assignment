  <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms
  to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
  It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
  Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.
  All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
  As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
  It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
  standard data structures, and the Document Object Model.
