      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms
        to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
        It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
        Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
        It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
        standard data structures, and the Document Object Model.
