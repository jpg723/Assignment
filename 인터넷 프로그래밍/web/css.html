      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility
        and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple
         web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate.
         css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content
         as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
         between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
