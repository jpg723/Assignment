      The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system
      where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators,
      which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.
      The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
      may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,
      and are published by a software application called a web server.
      The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
      which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
