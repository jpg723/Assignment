MY LOVE
- WEST LIFE
AN EMPTY STREET, AN EMPTY HOUSE
A HOLE INSIDE MY HEART
I'M ALL ALONE THE ROOMS ARE GETTING SMALLER
I WONDER HOW, I WONDER WHY
I WONDER WHERE THEY ARE
THE DAYS WE HAD THE SONGS WE SANG TOGETHER, OH YEAH
AND OH MY LOVE
I'M HOLDING ON FOREVER
REACHING FOR A LOVE THAT SEEMS SO FAR...
